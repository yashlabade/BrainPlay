## 🎮 Game Features

### ✅ *Correct Question Types*
1. *Square Calculation*: "What is X²?" (e.g., "What is 7²?")
   - Player calculates the square of a given number
   - Answer: X × X (e.g., 7² = 49)
   - Difficulty affects the range of base numbers

2. *Square Root*: "What is √X?" (e.g., "What is √144?")
   - Player calculates the square root of perfect squares
   - Answer: The number that when squared gives X (e.g., √144 = 12)
   - Difficulty affects the range of perfect squares

### 🆕 *Session Management*
- *Unique Session IDs* for each game
- *Player Profiles* with persistent statistics
- *Session Duration* tracking
- *Comprehensive Logging* of all events
